title: "About statistical power"
teaching: 60 
exercises: 120 
questions: 
- "What is power"
- "Why is it important: issues with low statistical power"
- "Some tools for power for neuroimaging"
objectives:
- "After this lesson, you should  understand what is Power, and the issues of low statistical power "
keypoints:
- The lack of power is much more problematic that it seems at first sight.
    - It would usually lead to wasted resources
    - If an under powered study yields some significant effects, these are likely to be overestimated
    - If an under powered study yields some significant effects, these are less likely to replicate

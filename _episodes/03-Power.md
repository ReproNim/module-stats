title: "About statistical power"
teaching: 60 
exercises: 120 
questions: 
- "What is power"
- "Why is it important: issues with low statistical power"
- "Some tools for power for neuroimaging"
objectives:
- "After this lesson, you should  understand what is Power, and the issues of low statistical power "
keypoints:
- The lack of power is much more problematic that it seems at first sight.
    - It would usually lead to wasted resources
    - If an under powered study yields some significant effects, these are likely to be overestimated
    - If an under powered study yields some significant effects, these are less likely to replicate

## Power : definition and some exercices 

First, doing some work on this notebook:

[Power](https://github.com/ReproNim/module-stats/blob/gh-pages/notebooks/Power-basics.ipynb)

## Some simple simulations  

> Exercise: 
>     visit this [site](http://rpsychologist.com/d3/NHST/) and set your test to
>     be one tailed at the false positive risk of 0.05. Say a typical effect size in
>     fMRI corresponds to a Cohen's d of 0.5. What is the sample size that you find ? 
>     Now, relate to what we are doing in fMRI. What is the problem ? can you use this
>     online tool to get the number of subjects for your experiment ? if yes, give a
>     typical example, if not, explain the problem.

## The Predictive Positive Value 

Then, on this one:

## Relation with confidence intervals ? 

Last, you'll need to go through :

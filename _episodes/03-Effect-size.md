## The general linear model: some simple explanations 

Here, we put links on a series of pages that explain the GLM and walk you though a number of exercises

## Variance explained 

##  What is an effect size, statistical versus biological or medical relevance

##  The variation of effect sizes 

###	    Variation with sampling, or variation because we are using a slighly different population 

###	    variation of effect size with a different model

###	    with workflow / pre-processing or over analysis choices parameters

### Unknown parameters

## Other measures of effect sizes

### 	can "prediction rate" be used ?

### 	can mutual information be used ?

- What is mutual information ? 
- Use as effect size ?

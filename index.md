Here we describe some key statistical concepts, and how to use them to make
your research more reproducible.  This module is a part of the training curriculum from the
[ReproNim](http://www.reproducibleimaging.org) (Reproducible Neuroimaging)
Center.

This course is a template for creating [ReproNim]({{site.rn_site}}) training
modules. The [template](https://github.com/repronim/module-template) for all
ReproNim modules is based on the templates of [Neurohackweek]({{site.nhw_site
}}), [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}) and [Software Carpentry]({{
site.swc_site }}) workshops.
